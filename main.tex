Previous research has estimated the number of false positive static analysis alerts to be as high as 70\%. Research has also shown that developers loose trust and ignore such tools when the number of false positive (or unimportant) alerts is high. Given that static analysis is still helpful in promoting cleaner code, different aspects from the history of the codebase can be exploited to improve the relevance of the output. If the output is matched to what the developer finds important or what has been proven to be helpful in the past, this will lead to a better acceptance and wider usage of such tools.

% I try to have four sentences in my abstract. The first states the problem. The second states why the problem is a problem. The third is my startling sentence. The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence. An abstract for this paper done in this style would be:

% The rejection rate for OOPSLA papers in near 90\%. Most papers are rejected not because of a lack of good ideas, but because they are poorly structured. Following four simple steps in writing a paper will dramatically increase your chances of acceptance. If everyone followed these steps, the amount of communication in the object community would increase, improving the rate of progress.
