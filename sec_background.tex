\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

\henrique{A Background section is not an Appendix. Specially for a thesis such as this, the main concepts you want to describe are important for a reader to better understand the techniques used.}

% What goes in the appendices? Any material which impedes the smooth development of your presentation, but which is important to justify the results of a thesis. Generally it is material that is of too nitty-gritty a level of detail for inclusion in the main body of the thesis, but which should be available for perusal by the examiners to convince them sufficiently. Examples include program listings, immense tables of data, lengthy mathematical proofs or derivations, etc. 

Possible concepts to explain/introduce in the thesis background section:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bayesian networks
    \item ML algorithms
    % \item Logistic regression
    % \item Principal component analysis
    % \item Correlation methods
    \item Precision, recall, auc \henrique{We usually describe Precision, Recall and other metrics used in the Evaluation as a subsection inside the evaluation.}
    % \item Deep learning
    % \item Clang AST (if used)
\end{itemize}
